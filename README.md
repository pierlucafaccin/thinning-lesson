# Thinning

This repository contains the material for the lesson-presentation of the course Signal, Image and Video. 

## Lesson
`FP_ThinningLesson.pdf` contains all the slide for the presentation. I decide to use the same template of Professor De Natale for the content, in order to keep a clear pattern. The folder `Data` contains 3 different images already converted.

## Jupyter Notebook 
`FP_ThinningLesson.ipynb` contains the three algorithm used to show different implementations of the application of the thinning method. The first and the second are presented with `openCV` and `Scikit-image` library, the third one is the Zhang-Suen Thinning Algorithm. In order to run the notebook, you need `python@3.9` and all packages in the `import` cell.
